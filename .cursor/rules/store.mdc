description: Zustand state management
globs: src/store/**/*.ts
---

- Single store pattern via `create<AppState>()`
- Actions defined within store, not as separate slices
- Keep state flat; avoid deeply nested objects
- All measurements stored in mm internally
- Use `get()` to access current state in actions
